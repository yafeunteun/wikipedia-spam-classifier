# Wikipedia Spam Classifier
The goal of the project is to build a machine learning classifier that is tuned to detect spammy article drafts.


## Role of this repo

The main goal of this repository is to share tools and code to build a machine learning classifier to detect spammy article drafts in wikipedia. 

It contains a Vagrantfile (see Vagrant at https://www.vagrantup.com/) that builds the virtual machine required for the development of this project alongside with some Jupyter Notebooks (https://jupyter.org/) which contains our prototypes. Apart from this the repo contains a folder names revscoring which is a clone of a generic, machine learning-based revision scoring system for MediaWiki (see https://github.com/wiki-ai/revscoring). 


## Requirement

Virtualbox https://www.virtualbox.org/ must be installed as well as Vagrant https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html. Everything else is provided by this repository.

It allows candidates to design their own jobs based on preferences of [[time]], [[location]], [[skills]] and [[pay]]. <ref>https://temploy.com/</ref>\n\n==History of Temploy==\nThe company was founded by [https://sg.linkedin.com/in/markgkoh Mark Koh] <ref>http://www.asianentrepreneur.org/mark-koh-founder-of-temploy/</ref> in October 2014. Temploy is a revolutionary platform, started with the aim of disrupting the traditional 9-5 work model and empowering job seekers, especially those who faced discriminatory hiring practices, to have more control over their career. <ref>https://e27.co/temploy-wants-shake-way-people-search-part-time-jobs-20141229/</ref> As work-life balance is increasingly the most desired trait in [[Asian]] workplaces, Temploy is able to fulfill these issues by allowing job-seekers to clearly state their availability and preferences, and employers can then choose the best fit for their needs. <ref>http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/singapore/part-timers-freelancers/2219008.html</ref>{{Infobox company\n| name = Temploy\n| former_names = Transcendant Concepts Private Limited\n| logo = [[File:Logo temploy.png|thumb|156x156px|Temploy logo]]\n| type = [[Privately held company|Private]]\n| founded = Singapore. October 2014.\n| founder = Mark Koh\n| hq_location_country = Singapore\n| key_people = <nowiki></nowiki>[[Mark Koh]] ([[Chief executive officer|CEO]])\n| members = Arvin Tang (COO), Ken Sim (CTO), Khairul Anwar (BD)\n| homepage = https://temploy.com/\n}}\n\n==Local Relevance of Temploy==\nSingapore is one of the fastest ageing population in Asia. Because people is one of Singapore\u2019s main competitive edge, it is no longer an option for elderly employees to stop  upgrading and working when they reach retirement age. <ref>http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/singapore-feeling-impact-rapidly-ageing-population</ref> However, due to the diverse and multi generational workforce we have at the moment, ageism is a worrying issue. The younger generations tend not to value the experiences older employees bring to the table. In addition to that, there are ample amount of jobs that are searching for part timers ultimately went to waste due to the lack of resources to inform citizens regarding the availability of the slots. Temploy aims to put an end to discrimination of job seekers due to ageism, as employers will only view the candidates profile base on their skill sets, expected salary and location preferences. Hence, if the candidates has the attribute needed by the company, meets the salary demand and agreeable working location, we will match them together regardless of their age, religion or gender.\n\n\nWork life balance is another major issue in Singapore. With over half or 55 per cent of respondents in 2013 <ref>http://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/ips/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/04/ST_Work-demands-getting-in-the-way-of-family-time_270515.pdf</ref> said that their work demands ate into their family time more than they liked. As Temploy\u2019s  mission says to \u201cdisrupt the traditional office-hour model of work and empower candidates to work closer to their ideal lifestyle and convenience\u201d, it hopes to be able to empower workers to make better job decision and at the same time achieve an optimal balance between work and life.\n\n\nIn many countries around the world, job creation is a big problem. However, in Singapore, the problem is different as it has more jobs than it can find workers for. Temploy offers a pool of both passive and active workers searching for part time and flexible work arrangement. With Temploy, employers could source for candidates more efficiently depending on the three criterions (skill sets, expected salary and location of preference) and make better and swifter hiring decisions.\n\n==Funding==\nTemploy, a Season 2 finalist in the Channel News Asia\u2019s Start-UP TV Show <ref>http://startup.channelnewsasia.com/s02/finalists</ref>, announced March 2015 that it had secured an equity investment from Indonesian enterprise tech firm, PT Walden Global Services (WGS). The company did not reveal the amount of the investment. <ref>https://e27.co/singapores-temploy-secures-funding-pt-walden-global-services-20150319/</ref> These funds will be used to grow their backend system softwares such as MyTeam, [[Payroll]], [[Open API]] and [[Data Analysis]].\n\n\n==Features==\n====Algorithm====\nTemploy makes use of nonlinear algorithm and [[nonlinear programming]] in their webapp to performing the matching between the candidates and the clients. This imperfect linear algorithm.\n\n====Human Layer====\nTemploy hopes to support the human layer for IOT companies. In IOT companies, the demand for part-time and ad hoc basis workers is ...\n\n==Business Model==\nUnlike other job portal like [[glints]], matchimi and joie etc who are more client centric, Temploy on the other hand are geared towards candidate centric. Hence, when candidate creates their profile, it enables Temploy to find a job that matches their criterion and match it with another company for further interview. It empowers them and gives them an opportunity to seek another source of income to earn a little more in life to obtain a better standard of living for themselves and their family.\n\n\nTemploy partners with many other organisations to achieve it's strategic goals. However, what differs Temploy from it's competitors is such that instead of the standard norm where candidates look for jobs from the employer's, Temploy seeks employers to search for suitable candidates through our anonymous, algorithm and automated platform. With this system in place, it eliminates any signs of prejudice, stereotypes as well as discrimination because matches will be based on skill sets, expected salary and location of preference. Hence, employers will be looking at the candidate's profile based on these criterions rather than judging from a person\u2019s physical, religious or gender outlook.\n\n\nThe main users of Temploy webapp are part-timers, flexi-timers and [[freelancers]] who are looking for a supplement of income that are within their reach and convenience. Having created a profile with Temploy and invited for a job offer, the job seekers have the control over their working decision. The primary target group of individuals are discriminated or at risk workers, however the main bulk of users are currently students from 18 to 24 years of age who are seeking for an extra allowance, especially during their holiday season.\n\n\nAs a company, Temploy itself employs a mix of part-timers, flexi-timers and [[freelancers]], including its finance head, to support operations. The firm said hiring such free agents is not only more affordable than full-time hires, but it also has a shorter on-boarding time, allowing them to begin work in a shorter period. <ref>http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/singapore/part-timers-freelancers/2219008.html</ref> \n\n\n==Future Development and Expansion==\n[[File:Temploy Timeline.jpg|centre|thumb|720x720px|Temploy Developmental Plans for 2016]]\nTemploy might roll out a premium feature in the near future for candidate verification, to safeguard the interest of the employer.<ref>https://vulcanpost.com/25031/earn-money-temploy/</ref> The premium feature is based on a subscription model.\n\n\nTemploy is also looking out for more venture capital investors to invest in their bigger social vision of eliminating discrimination.\n\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n<!--- After listing your sources please cite them using inline citations and place them after the information they cite.

Jesse_Ridgway	696968930	20151227073708	1	attack	Jesse Tyler Ridgway (Born: September 29, 1992), better known by his two YouTube nicknames as McJuggerNuggets and/or Psycho Kid, is the titular protagonist/anti-hero of The "Psycho" series and the main antagonist of the Big Brudda Series. He is a dedicated gamer much to the annoyance of his father. Jesse having YouTube as a job rather than a conventional job is one of the main causes for his strained relationship with his father. \n\n== Biography ==\nJesse was born on September 29, 1992. After his birth, not much is known, but Jesse does confirm that his most traumatizing year in his childhood was when he was 8 in 2000. A tad obese Jesse gets his lower legs immobilized when he walked through hot asphalt. That same year, he was attacked by a savage Fred, one of his childhood dogs. He was rushed to medics on both occasions after suffering critical effects.\n\n\nJesse in the 8th grade.\n\nExpand slideshow4 of 6Add photo\nRise To Prominence\nJesse started his YouTube channel, "McJuggerNuggets" on December 9, 2006 and came up with name "McJuggerNuggets" after using the washroom. Prior to this, he had Chicken McNuggets. He named his channel "McJuggerNuggets" and started making various videos soon after. Despite having a weight problem, it was a time when his family was supportive to the gradually slow success of the channel, starting from his first videos. [1]\n\nThe "Psycho" Series\nIn 2012, just on the verge of Christmas, Jesse, having a strong passion for gaming, gets his Xbox console thrashed by his father in Psycho Dad Destroys Xbox. After knowing that this event got put on YouTube by Jeffrey, his brother; Jesse blackmails him and threatens to show his father the video. This results in getting his camera broken by Jeffrey in Psycho Brother's Filming Freakout, which later outcomes in getting Jeffrey's laptop broken in Psycho Dad Axes Laptop. \n\nBrain Injury\nIn 2014, he got a concussion while filming a skit titled "21 Shots", when he fell face-first onto a table. This was a major impact in Jesse's life. At the end of 2014, he described the year as the craziest one in his life.\n\nFirst Conflict with Psycho Dad\nJob Concern\nFA\nJesse moments before witnessing his video games grinded into shreds by his father\nOn July 11, 2014, Jeffrey randomly decided to cut off some of his hair for fun, leading to Psycho Brother Clips Head. Later, 3 months after Jesse had graduated college, his dad decided he needed to stop gaming and get a job. He ran over the games with a lawnmower in Psycho Dad Shreds Video Games, his most viewed video to date, reaching over 25 million views. A few weeks later, Jesse was grounded for an unknown reason, and was caught by his brother playing on a Game Boy with his friend Buzz. Jeffrey told on him, which led to a big argument between Jesse and his father, with Jesse ending up smashing his dad's TV with a baseball bat in Psycho Kid Smashes TV. He then temporarily moved out and came back eventually. During the same grounding, Jesse goes out to the shed to play Halo Reach, away from his family, but his Dad, because of Jeffrey, finds him playing and throws the Xbox in the pool in Psycho Dad Drowns Xbox. Jesse was then going to job interviews but ends up going to get his Xbox 360 fixed. He was caught coming in the house by his dad, and he throws it through the car windows when he founds out Jesse got the money from his mother in Psycho Dad Wrecks Car.\nHis dad, Jeffrey and Jesse's friend Zachary Cornatzer (also known as Corn) come into his room while sleeping on Halloween and squirt ketchup on him and run a chainsaw to make him think that he got sawed up by a chainsaw in Psycho Kid's Halloween Bloodbath. Jesse decided to get him back with the prank in Psycho Dad Chainsaws Xbox One, but it leads to his father sledgehammering his Xbox One. There is a big argument at Thanksgiving dinner, which leads to Jesse flipping over the tables and throwing pie at his father in Psycho Kid Ruins Thanksgiving. A week and a half later, Jesse decides to apologize to the family in Psycho Family Apology, but his father says "Don't expect anything for Christmas this year either.", which leads to Jesse's outrage of getting nothing for Christmas, despite getting numerous items from his sub-series Fan Mail Mondays, which started not long before the apology.\n\nOn Christmas morning, Jesse gets \nImgres\nJesse prepares to set fire to the Christmas tree.\nreindeer antlers, while Jeffrey gets an Xbox One. Jesse decided to set the tree on fire because he didn't get the Wii U he wanted in Psycho Kid Torches Christmas Tree. His mother ends up getting him one at the end of the video.\nJesse v. Psycho Dad v. Psycho Brother\n"Jesse's dad is a big fat bitch, he's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world!"\n\u2014 Jesse parodying a South Park Episode\nJesse sings a song parodying a song from South Park on one of his Twitch streams making fun of his dad, not knowing his dad was watching the stream. He then comes in and takes his monitor and destroys it in Psycho Dad Raids Stream. A few weeks later, Jeffrey and his girlfriend Kate were arguing about how lazy he is, and Jesse was filming it. Kate ends up smashing Jeffrey's tablet against the corner of a wall in Psycho Girlfriend Breaks iPad. A few days later, Jesse decides to make a celebration video for reaching 500K subscribers, but Jeffrey ruins it by taking his YouTube Play Button for reaching 100K subscribers, which leads to a clash between the two, which leads to their father interceding the fight and destroying Jesse's play button in Psycho Dad Shatters Youtube Play Button.\n\nJesse-Airplane-Video-Games\nJesse plays Nintendo\nJesse and his father then get invited to be on the TV show in London called "Virtually Famous" because of the Psycho Series. One day while in London, Jesse stays in the hotel playing DS while his dad went sightseeing. They get in an argument and his dad curb-stomps the DS, in Psycho Dad Pounds Nintendo DS. Jeffrey decided to get payback from the iPad video, so he tricked Jesse to thinking there was a replacement play button on the porch, but there is not. Jesse gets locked out after going outside in Psycho Brother's Frozen Lockout.\n\nFirst Banishment\nTrophy/Wii U Incident\nX240-Vu0\nJesse thrashes Jeff Sr.'s trophies\nNearing the end of March, Jeffrey and Jesse planned a revenge video for the play button destruction that would involve smashing some of his father's baseball trophies from when he was a kid. Jesse and Jeffrey worked out a plan together. They put their dad's trophies in a box and went outside, where their father was making burgers on the grill and Jesse says "Remember how you destroyed my Play Button for YouTube?" and smashes the first trophy on the ground. When his dad walks close up to him, Jesse smashes more trophies which leads to a freak-out of his dad, setting the Wii U on fire in Psycho Dad Grills Wii U and gets Jesse kicked out of the house. After Jesse's exile, Jesse kept updating his subscribers by uploading daily vlogs. His mother and Jeffrey bring him food and clothes out to his tent or the garage, while Jeffrey starts to grow more insecure. Jesse now calls the tent "Eagles Landing", using two eagles from one of the trophies as an inspiration for Jesse. Jeffrey also gave Jesse his old Laptop so he can still upload the videos. Jesse has also been able to get electricity, thanks to a friend called Mr. H who gave him a generator to borrow while he was out of the house and living in his tent. He then bought more supplies for his tent, including an Xbox 360 and a TV and snuck into the house to collect his Skyrim game while he lives in his tent. However, Jeffrey then blows Jesse's Skyrim raid when Jeffrey calls out his dad. Jesse then plans to relocate Eagles Landing.\n\nDestruction of Eagles Landing\nSince then Jesse had still been "technically" living on his family's property. He has completed his Eagle's\nSonny\nJesse converses with his father\nLanding gaming setup as well. On April 11 2015, Jesse woke up to find that none of his cables were powered. He found that they were unplugged from the garage along with a note that explained: "If I find out you've been stealing electricity again, there will be consequences." This made Jesse ponder what to do next. Later that day he decided to use the generator that his neighbor let him borrow but it was too loud. The same night he decided to post a tweet asking if he should move his tent and setup farther into the woods, or stay and fight. He also uploaded a video later that night asking his viewers to respond to him about the question. In the end he stood his ground and plugged the power cords in, but his dad came and bulldozed his entire tent & setup the next day in Psycho Dad Flattens Gaming Lair. Everything in the tent was either destroyed or damaged badly. Jesse later launched a daring raid on the house to gather some items (fortunately, it didn't come to blows with Psycho Dad) to stay at his friend Zack Dingler's house. What is next is still being decided by Jesse.\nSettlement at Zack Dingler's\nAfter Eagle's Landing was destroyed Jesse moved to Zack's house. He never did see Zack or his family, although Zack was in a few of Jesse's older videos. While he was at Zack's house he could live his old life the way he used to. After a while though he decided to move from Zack's house. His parents were not fully on board with it, Zack himself wasn't feeling up to it by getting in the way, so Jesse made a few vlogs asking viewers if he should go stay with his girlfriend Juliette Reilly (who was a college student). In the end he decided it was so, and he drove up to Pennsylvania.\n\nSettlement at Juliette Reilly's\nMaxresdefaultered\nJesse and Juliette enjoy themselves\nWhile with Juliette and her friends, Jesse felt more loved and at home than anywhere he previously was. He stayed in an air mattress in her room, and when she went of to class he toured around the campus, city, and condos. He then received an offer to stay with his uncle Larry Abraham, and asked on Twitter/YouTube if he should go back to Zack's house, or go with Uncle Larry. He decides to go to Larry's house.\nSettlement at The Abraham Household\nWhen arriving at Uncle Larry's house, Jesse is greeted by his uncle, holding a beer. After talking a bit about rules and cats, Jesse talked with is cousin Tom Abraham. Larry invites him to work one day, only to find out that his mom had been making T-shirts to sell to the "Juggies". They come home to a voicemail, left by Jeffrey Sr., saying he shouldn't be at his house. Jesse is then forced to stay outside in the tent titled "Phoenix Landing".\n\nJeffrey's Emergence\nMeanwhile, Jeffrey decided to pull a prank and paintball Jesse's tent, only to be reversed on, destroying Jeffrey's camera lens. As revenge, he destroys all of the trophies in JESSE SMASHES TROPHIES! (Broken Lens Revenge), and frames it on Jesse. After Jesse's dad finds the trophies, he goes to Uncle Larry's house, and destroys one of two DS Lites from Fan Mail Mondays. Uncle Larry defends Jesse, saying that Jesse was innocent and that it was most likely that Jeffrey did it. Jesse's father throws a chair on the ground, and is threatened by Larry to leave, or he would call the cops in PSYCHO DAD FIGHTS UNCLE LARRY!.\n\nOn April 26th, Jesse gets into Larry's RV, at long last. He and Larry found the video of Jeffrey Jr. smashing the trophies, and thinks of a plan to get back in the house, by making a video with Juggies reciting a speech. The following day, Jesse's channel (after 8 years) finally reached 1,000,000 Juggies/Subscribers.\n\nHomecoming\nJesse-Kidnapped\nJesse is kidnapped by Jeffrey\nOn May 1st, 2015, Jesse is kidnapped by Jeffrey and drives him to The Ridgway Residence. Jesse makes his move by showing his father the Juggies Unite video and Jeffrey Jr. smashing his childhood baseball trophies. After a moment of silence, Jeff Sr. decides that Jesse could take residence in the home in under the condition that he worked for his father for free and paid rent. Jeffrey, on the other hand for framing Jesse of smashing a second stash of trophies gets his camera thrashed.\nOn May 5th, 2015, Jesse, his family (except Jeffrey since he was away at the time), and his girlfriend Juliette was "swatted."[1]\n\nFunding Struggles\nJesse-Arrested\nJesse is arrested by Jeff. Sr's friend\n"I play Grand Theft Auto, I know how this works!"\n\u2014 Jesse talks back to Jeff Sr's friend, who he thought was an officer of the law\n"Scared Straight" Arrest\nAfter the swatting, Jesse, despite the fact that how much he had to pay, was forced to pay the bill but ended up in a brief argument most of the time. On May 21, 2015, Jesse gets supposedly arrested while causing a tantrum in a store. Jesse apologizes to the store and talks to Joan, the mother of supposedly the store owner. After declining that she did not call the cops, Jesse's mother, Theresa reveals that the arrest was set up by his father and his mischievous brother & that the goal was to force Jesse into respecting them. An argument occurs in a therapy session a week or so later. Around that time, Jesse makes amends with Zachary Cornatzer, which the two had a falling during the events of Psycho Dad Crashes WoW LAN Party.\n\nVideo Game Burial\nPsychodad on tractor 2\nJesse argues with Jeff Sr. soon before he buries Jesse's video games\nJesse also gets into the merchandise business and starts making t-shirts. However, his mistake was taking the risk of making a limited time "Psycho Dad" t-shirts, which was a two-week store exclusive for Father's Day. Jeff.

Jesse goes back to the site of the buried video games (Jesse did manage to get some games before E3), only to find out that the hole was covered up. Jesse and Jeffrey give their father a grill for Father's Day, which convoluted into an argument between Jesse and Jeff. Sr.. Jeff. Sr reveals that while Jesse was at E3, his father scooped up all the video games.\nNorth Carolina Vacation\nJeffrey's Punishment\nLeading to their trip to North Carolina, Larry Abraham , Jeffrey Ridgway Jr. & Jesse film a Kung-Fu skit days before their departure. Jeffrey complains of his role as a female character and freaks out, shouting and insulting the latter. Despite Jesse insisting Jeffrey to come to the trip, Jeffrey disagrees and is punished by not coming to the trip.\n\nArriving at North Carolina \nComing Soon!\n\nWii Skirmish\nPsycho Dad Launches Wii 02\nJesse begs for Jeff Sr. not to throw the Wii into the water\nWhen Tom and Larry film a Chillin' & Grillin' episode, Jeffrey Ridgway Sr. argues with Theresa Abraham-Ridgway, which leads to a mononucleosis -infected Jesse nagging behind his father as he throws the house Wii into the nearby river. An argument occurs inside the house about the Wii and Jeff Jr.'s actions back in New Jersey. In the aftermath, Jeff Sr. requests Jesse to go kayaking when he and Larry were searching for the remains of the Wii, which he reluctantly accepts. When they reach nearby land, Jesse realizes this was a trick when his father leaves him stranded on the island. However, Larry rescues him and brings him back to the vacation house.\n\nPrank War\nLater on Jesse's, Jesse secretly goes on Jeff. Jr's computer and uploads a prank video (MCJUGGERNUGGETS TAKEOVER!) on to BigBrudda to attempt to tell Jeff Jr. not to leave his PC on. Since then, Jeff. Jr's and Jesse's relationship has gone unstable and formed into a prank war. Jeffrey interrupts Jesse's live-stream by filling his room with smoke using fog machines in Psycho Brother Smokes Out Stream.\n\nOperation Orange Crush\nPsycho Revenge 1\nJesse and Larry beat Jeffrey's PS4 with a baseball bat and nunchucks\nOn August 19, 2015, Jesse steals the keys of Jeff.

However, Jeffrey quickly reciprocates by paintball the truck, but Jesse, Larry and Corn manage to escape, despite Jesse being shot once while dragging the PS4 on the empty roads. Jesse and Larry stop and beat the PS4 to pieces.\n\nJesse-Jeff-Jr-Threaten\nJesse taunts & threatens Jeffrey\nAs revenge, Jeffrey stole two PS4's and an Xbox One Jesse was planning to do a giveaway with, as well as claim the PlayStations as his own. However, Jesse and Larry convince Jeffrey to give back the consoles, despite hiding his Batman Collectible Statue in the Fan Mail room if anything happened. Jesse has Larry secure his room from any danger with a deadbolt.\nJeffrey's Revenge\nIn an attempt to make amends with his brother, Jeffrey sneakily stole the keys to the deadbolt and locked Jesse in. Despite believing he didn't have a second key, Jesse had to go through the window in order to get out of the house. Jeffrey taunts Jesse in not giving the location of the key and in turn, Jesse pronounces him a villain.\n\nA few days later, under the belief that Larry had the second key, Jesse calls him in an attempt to get the second key. However, Larry reveals that despite recommending it, he put it on Jesse's car key chain, much to Jesse's surprise. Jesse unlocks his door and carols Hallelujah to celebrate.\n\nSecond Conflict with Psycho Dad\nFraming Jeffrey\n"I just told you why, so this motherfucker wouldn't come in my room!"\n\u2014 Jesse to Jeff Sr. about why he put a deadbolt on his door\nJesse-Overhearing\nJesse overhears Jeffrey being lashed out by their father\nAfter unlocking his deadbolt with a key on his key chain, Jesse decides to get back the other key by telling his father of the key theft under the lie that Jeffrey deadbolt the lock on the door.

However, when doing the QnA, Jesse's substandard behavior forces Jeff Sr. to cross the line and lash out at Jesse. Despite Jesse's pleads, Jeff Sr. denies to come back to the QnA after being embarrassed on film.\n\nOperation Pitfall\nAt this point, Jesse wanted to get Jeffrey back for all his pranks, so he decides to steal his Batman statue for his plan. He then got his father to use the backhoe to dig a hole, and then having Uncle Larry teaching him on how to tie the statue and finally, he ties the statue on top of a tree branch. He then convinced Corn to be in the prank and fill in the hole. On the day of the prank, Jesse takes Jeffrey to the hole where the Batman statue is. While Jeffrey knows about the hole, he tries to get the statue down with a rake, leading to Jesse pushing him down the hole.\n\nSecond Banishment\nRoom Incident\n8e8202fe3442d4295ba1c043b97acc05\nJesse argues with his father in his trashed room\nWhile Jesse and Larry were setting up an introduction for a livestream, Jeffrey Ridgway Sr. orders Jesse to unlock his door. Despite saying that he will let him in in 10 seconds, Jeff Sr. busts down the door and trashes his table, Juliette Reilly's gifts, various posters and his TV. Jesse quickly learns that Jeffrey Ridgway Jr. was the mastermind of this attack, with his father as a pawn as revenge for the pitfall prank. Jeff Sr. orders him to pack up "in 10 seconds", as this is another way of saying that he was banished after manipulating his family to turn on his brother. Struggling to pack, Jesse and Larry leave the house. During this, they encounter Theresa Abraham-Ridgway, whom Jesse begs to defend him, but even she was mad after she was set up by her son. Larry drives away with a crying Jesse.\n\nMisunderstanding\nA few days after being kicked out, Jesse manipulated Tom to film Jesse covering Jeff Jr.'s 2006 Dodge Charger with plastic wrap. This leads into a fight with Larry, who is ordered by Jeff Sr. to kick him out of the house. Larry also reveals Jeff Jr.'s plan to put BigBrudda T-Shirts on the market. Jesse leaves his 1,000,000 subscriber Play Button that he received a day after he was "kicked out" and walks away from Larry, now having everyone in his family against him. Or so he thinks. The next day, Larry posts a plea to Jesse on his channel, stating he didn't kick Jesse out, and never would.\n\nSettlement at The Cornatzer Residence\nBigbruddaconfrontationhighres\nJesse and Jeffrey argue about BigBrudda T-Shirts\nUnder the belief that he was betrayed by Larry, Jesse calls out Zachary Cornatzer, a friend he can truly rely on to pick him up. Jesse takes shelter in The Cornatzer Residence sleeping in Bethany Cornatzer's room, who was at college. Jesse and Corn gather equipment & supplies for an upcoming stream.\nThe next day, Jesse makes a daring move to confront his mother and Larry about the BigBrudda T-Shirts, worried that they wouldn't sell and be a blow (despite the fact that his mother & Larry were OK with the idea). Larry attempts to explain the truth about him saying to leave the house, but Jesse doesn't listen. Jesse takes with him after a new Eagles Landing T-Shirt.\n\nThe following day, Jeffrey Ridgway Jr. comes to visit him about the BigBrudda T-Shirts. While Jesse still believed that the shirts would be a major turning point in the shop, He and Jeffrey reached a point that Jesse would be allowed in the house if the revenue was dropped down from 30% to 5% and advertising the shirts on Jesse's next stream.\n\nReturn\nOn September 19, 2015, Jesse and Corn returned to Larry's house, only to find out that Jesse's family arranged a meal for them, despite the fact that Jesse felt uncomfortable being there. The family ate while Corn filmed. Larry called out the family to bring Jesse back in after Larry feels that he is partly responsible for Jesse's second banishment. The family one by one stood up to bring Jesse back in -  even Jeffrey Ridgway Jr. - and everyone did agree with the exception of Jeffrey Ridgway Sr.. Outnumbered, Jesse was taken by Jeff Sr. to his car, where Jesse seemingly was allowed back into the house again.\n\nSecond Banishment Aftermath\nAfter being allowed back in for the second time, Jesse had to fix his posters - previously smashed in Psycho Dad Busts Down Door - and also had to cope with using a dog gate for his door until one could have been installed. At the same time, Zachary Cornatzer's social media accounts became compromised by a hacker, as well as Jesse's phone numbers. Jesse managed to get his 1,000,000 subscriber Play Button back and after a brief argument, reached a compromise to hang it in the family living room.\n\nJesse-Wii-U-Unbox\nJesse unboxes a replacement Wii U for his early birthday party\nBirthday Week\nBirthday Bash\nAt his early birthday party, Jesse was gifted a Wii U from his mother (despite two prank gifts from Zachary and Jeff Jr.), much to Jeffrey Ridgway Sr.'s annoyance after singing Happy Birthday. He gets furious when he sees the Wii U gamepad - he mistakes it for a computer - and throws the console at a tree after hurling it at a glass door. An emotionally injured Jesse spends the night at Corn's house.\n\nDoor Replacement\nWhen Jesse's actual birthday arrived, Larry and Jesse go out to get a replacement door for his birthday. The following day, Jesse gets suspicions of Jeffrey Ridgway Jr. when he went quiet about the BigBrudda shirts. This leads to an argument until Jeffrey Ridgway Sr.  handed Jesse his monthly bill, but he was angry when he saw that it was overpriced. This was due to the events of Psycho Kid's Birthday Bash, which led to another argument.\n\nConstruction in the Morton Building\nJesse-Construction-Crew\nJesse and the construction crew\nAfter being granted the overpriced monthly bill by Jeffrey Ridgway Sr., Jesse decides to move into the family's morton building just yards away from the house, having permission from his father, who wants no part of the construction and takes it as Jesse's responsibility. The next day, Jesse hires Larry, Corn & friends Mark Locuson (builders) and Buzz Simkins (electrical handyman) as his construction team (dubbed the RiDGiD Construction Crew), who goes underway into construction. Jeffrey Ridgway Jr. enacted revenge for using his truck without permission by graffiting the floor, but Jesse managed to erase it. Halfway through construction, he watched his subscribers rise to the 2 Million milestone, having Barium Salute to celebrate. Nearing the end of construction, Jesse, Mark & friend Parker have an "Epic Paint Fight" while coating the walls with color.\nThe Customization of Jesse's Car and Destruction of Jeffrey's Motorcycle\nFreakout\nJesse screams at Corn after seeing his painted car\nOn October 13, 2015, after seeing the MCJUGGERNUGGETS CAR PRANK [2], Jesse flew into a rage after seeing his car being painted fuchsia - Jesse describing it as hot pink, but Jeffrey confirmed it was fuchsia - and proceeded to run into the woods, telling Corn not to follow. He was next seen in the process of refilling the hole, last seen during the Pitfall Prank, during which he tells Corn to call Mark. Reluctantly, Corn and Mark are forced by Jesse to move Jeffrey's motorcycle into the hole. Despite their reluctance, they do so as Jesse berates them the entire time. After the deed is done, Corn and Mark leave.\n\nFan reactions to this debacle were fairly consistently negative, with the video receiving more than 30,000 dislikes (with only a little more than 11,000 likes), and the McJuggerNuggets YouTube channel going from roughly 2,032,500 to 2,025,181 subscribers in just five hours.[3]\n\nA day later, he was down to nearly 2,018,000 subscribers from the same video. \n\nThreatened\nJesse-Speeding\nJesse speeds to The Ridgway Residence\n"The clock is ticking: You have one fucking hour."\n"The "clock is ticking"? What does that even mean?"\n\u2014 Jeffrey Ridgway Jr. & Jesse Ridgway\nWhile enjoying his time with Juliette Reilly, Jesse was contacted by Jeffrey and was threatened to apologize to him in person within the hour for the motorcycle destruction or else he would destroy his room. Despite having a small belief that he was lying, Jesse immediately had no choice but to leave Juliette for the safety of his Morton Building. He drives at high-speed and manages to make close timing arriving at The Ridgway Residence. When Jesse goes to investigate the room, he is locked in by Jeffrey, revealing that he set him up & wanted to give him what he deserved. Jesse bared with the items inside while having no access to Wi-Fi & was rescued by Larry and Corn the next morning. Since then, the crew resumed construction, despite a minor feud with Jeffrey. On October 24, the crew wrapped up construction and started to add furniture.\n\nAttack of McJokerNuggets\nJesse-Light-Em-Up\nJesse lights up fireworks\nOn Halloween's Day 2015 (October 31st, 2015) One day, while working, Jeffrey comes in and tells that he has planned a party for Halloween night. Although Jesse does state not to go near his room, he loses and the conversation ends when Jeffrey taunts him about not working at all. A few days later, it is postponed to the previous day on Friday.  On Friday, Jesse (in The Dark Knight Joker costume) had Zachary Cornatzer (in ear of corn costume) film him troll Jeffrey (in Batman costume). This backfires and Jesse retaliates with fireworks. However, Jeffrey Ridgway Sr., dressed as The Incredible Hulk, appears and sabotages the party. Jeffrey, angered, graffitied a penis on Jesse's room. Jesse attacks Jeffrey, but is quickly overpowered. Theresa Abraham-Ridgway appears and is in distress of the events. Jesse is left to clean up of the mess that had just ensued.\n\nMcJokerNuggets Aftermath\nJust after the party, Jesse realizes that there is a hole in his built room, which he believed that Jeffrey forced it with a chair. He has Zachary Cornatzer and Larry Abraham fix the hole - the room is officially finished. Jesse does express interest in a gaming crew he would liked to establish. \n\nWhile doing a laxative prank on Jeffrey Ridgway Jr., he has Corn escorted out of Jesse's room for an upcoming prank that he describes as minor and harmless. Corn reluctantly accepts to take part for 500$ and lies to Jesse saying that the two had concerns over streaming. Jesse would later confront Corn about the prank after watching DEAL WITH CORN.\n\nOperation Nameless\nJesse caught in trap\nJesse furiously tries to grab Jeffrey while stuck in the trap.\nOn November 16, 2015 Jesse and Corn are about to film a Fan Mail, when all of a sudden, Corn starts acting very suspiciously. Corn asks Jesse to come with him outside. After approaching The Pit, Jesse sees his PS4 hanging above the pit. Jeffrey Jr. emerges from the busted door. Jesse tries to retrieve the PS4, but Jeffrey Jr. activates the pulley system, trapping Jesse in the tarp. After much begging, Jeffrey Jr. tells Jesse that he wants him to replace his motorcycle. Once Jesse agrees to buy a new motorcycle for Jeffrey Jr., Jesse is let out of the tarp. Attempting to peacefully walk away, Jesse continues to be taunted by Jeffrey Jr. Once Jeffrey Jr. knocks Jesse's glasses from his face, Jeffrey Jr. stomps on the glasses. This causes Jesse to snap, and wrestle Jeffrey Jr.. Corn, now on Jesse's side again, tackles Jeffrey Jr. off of Jesse, providing enough time for Jesse to escape. Corn cannot escape Jeffrey Jr., so Jesse takes one of Larry Abraham's littered Corona bottles and shatters it against Jeffrey Jr.'s head, knocking him unconscious and saving Corn.\n\nImmediately picking up where "Operation Nameless" left off, Jesse and Corn drag Jeffrey Jr.'s unconscious body into the nearby dog cage. The two initially argue at first, but after hours of silence, Jeffrey Jr. finally decides to have the serious conversation. Jeffrey Jr. revealed that his father had forced him to do things he did not want to do for his whole life, therefore making his life a misery. He also told Jesse that he wanted to film as a career, and not be an accountant, which also was forced to do by his dad. After the deep conversation, Jeffrey Jr. is then released from the dog cage, and peacefully walks into the house.\n\nParents Separated\nPDMH-32\nJesse pleads for Theresa to stay at The Ridgway Residence\nAfter being shattered with the bottle, Jeffrey had a change of personality and grew quiet throughout the following days. When Theresa Abraham-Ridgway confronted him, but Jesse denied the information and used many excuses, such as getting drunk during a New York trip. Jeff Sr. overheard the conversation and also confronts him - Jesse still doesn't give up what happened to Jeffrey. Presumably off-screen, Theresa confronted Jeffrey and eventually found out that he was hit in the head with a beer bottle.\n\n"Please, think about this! I know it's a heat of the moment, I know it's intense, I've dealt with this shit too! Please! Take me with you!"\n\u2014 Jesse pleads to go with Theresa\nOn November 25, 2015, while off-screen, Jeffrey Ridgway Sr. managed to get find out what happened to Jeffrey Ridgway Jr. via Theresa, and in turn, smashes many items Jesse's room. This leads to an argument with Theresa and Jeff Sr., which ends with the latter pushing Jesse into a lamp and leaving the room. He proceeds to shatter Jesse's car window with a baseball bat, and at this exact moment, Theresa snaps and declares divorce, despite the pleads of Jeff Sr. and Jesse. All packed up, Theresa leaves. Jesse attempts to chase her before giving up and sobbing on the driveway.\n\nMother and Son Reunion\nBromance-Just-Got-Real\nJesse cries and hugs it out on Jeffrey Ridgway Jr.\nSome time right after Psycho Mom Divorces Husband, Jesse is in his destroyed room looking at his broken things and items on his shelves. Jeffrey Ridgway Jr., returning from a gym workout arrives in his room and is confused of the destruction. Jesse goes to hug his brother and tells him that his mother legitimately broke up with Jeffrey Ridgway Sr. & will divorce when they sign the paperwork. The following afternoon, Jeff Jr. and Jesse have Thanksgiving with Jeff Sr. with his side of the family - Jesse is forbidden to capture footage of it by Jeff Sr.. After Thanksgiving, Jesse has an idea to go celebrate a second Thanksgiving at The Abraham Household the following night, which Jeff Jr. accepts.\nAbraham-Thanksgiving-2015-With-Jesse\nJesse celebrates Thanksgiving at The Abraham Household\nThe two drive to The Abraham Household and find that Theresa went into hiding there. The two brothers meet again and hug it out. Jesse asks her if there is a possibility that she could not divorce and stay with Jeff Sr., but she responds that the chances of that happening were slim, saying that Jeff Sr. gets angry when she interferes. The two have a deep conversation about where they are going to be after, which Jesse confirms that he will move out during mid-January 2016, as told before in a QnA video. After the conversation, Thanksgiving dinner was prepared and the family (excluding Jeff Sr.) and relatives start eating.\n\nComputer Repair\nJesse-Comforts-Theresa\nJesse attempts to comfort Theresa Abraham-Ridgway after revealing the broken hard-drive\nAfter a couple of Days at Larry's Jesse mentions to Uncle Larry about moving her sister temporary into the RV and so they go ahead with that idea. Jesse and Zachary Cornatzer return to The Ridgway Residence after going out for something to eat to find Jeffrey Ridgway Sr. throwing various pieces of clothing belonging to Theresa Abraham-Ridgway onto the front lawn. Jesse and Corn attempt to stop him from destroying her computer tower, but it is too late as it has been destroyed with a log splitter. Luckily for Jesse and Corn, with the help of Tom and Larry Abraham, they manage to recover the hard drive, where most of the information is kept. Jesse shows Theresa the hard drive, but only gets a saddening response - she reveals that she has been invited to stay with her friend and Jesse's non-biological aunt Melissa Sherman-Stahlberger. \nDedicating to still fix it, Jesse visit Corn's dad John Cornatzer to help fix the drive, but ultimately finds that it was twisted. Jesse, Corn and Larry go to the computer shop in a second attempt to find the drive's status, but the worker said that it was a possibility that it was destroyed - a few minutes later, it was confirmed that the damage the log splitter caused destroyed the drive.\n\nTroubles with Aunt Melissa\nJesse-Theresa-Melissa-Larry-Argument\nJesse argues with Melissa Sherman-Stahlberger\nOne time, Jesse went to see Theresa Abraham-Ridgway at The Abraham Household only to find her drinking wine with Melissa Sherman-Stahlberger in Larry's RV without permission. Melissa starts to insult Jeffrey Ridgway Sr., prompting Jesse to defend him, despite the fact that he has destroyed a majority of his belongings. Jesse finds Larry Abraham and the two return to the RV. Jesse points out the possibility that Jeff Sr. could change, but the two had trouble understanding since they were drunk - Melissa continues to insult the Ridgway family, but is forced to apologize after attempting to take Larry's wine. Ultimately, Larry and Jesse leave the RV after Larry backlashes Melissa.\nTo be Added\n\nJuggies Store Devastation\nJesse-TS-Aftermath\nJesse after the Destruction of the Juggies Store\nOne day, Jesse decides to go to the Juggies Store to overview a new shirt design that Theresa made. When he arrives, he sees Larry Abraham making final preparations for the concurrent Christmas sale. When he sees the newly-designed "Anti-Juggie" shirts, Jeff Sr. arrives and talks out the future of his relationship with Theresa. When she confirms that she will be no longer moving back, Jeff Sr. goes in a fit of rage and throws his roses that he gave to her, flips two tables, destroys the equipment and ruins the clothing. Larry returns back with a pipe in hand and threatens him out of the warehouse. Jesse and Larry insist that Theresa should call the police, but she reveals that she still cares for him and that the cops will not solve anything.\n\nSource: http://psychokid.wikia.com/wiki/Jesse_Ridgway\n

Canis_careyus	717440763	20160427183549	1	vandalism	The Canis Careyus was a fierce organism that lived thousands of years ago in the BC 2000s. It rose to become an apex predator, but quickly became extinct. The dog lived in  northern ''[[North America]] Scientists have debated whether such a creature ever existed, though many say that it has. It didn't last long enough to make a huge impact, but if it had not been hunted down to extinction by humans, it would still be one of the fiercest breed of dogs ever to live. The Carey dog, which was named after the man who found the evidence for such a creature, was a carnivore. It had long canines so that it could shred meat easier. The Canis Careyus also had claws which had a netting between them, so that if their prey tried to swim from them, the prey would be eaten faster. The dog's fur was thick, so that during the winter seasons it would survive with ease. The dog's fur was also useful as its color allowed the dog to be camouflaged and hunt easier. The Canis Careyus had huge paws so that during the winter, it would be able to walk on the snow. No pictures of this magnificent beast exist, for the Canis Careyus lived in a place where the tribes who lived there had to need to draw but only a need to hunt and to gather. The Canis Careyus feasted on all of the animals and fish besides humans that it saw. Humans hunted it to extinction and burned its bones as a sacrifice to their gods, so very little evidence has ever been found of its existence. The mating ritual of the Canis Careyus was to puff out all of the fur in its body, and then hope that a female found it satisfactory. The Canis Careyus usually first has two female offspring before having a male offspring. The Carey dog was able to learn to do things that only very few animals ever knew about. It was able to learn to light a stick on fire by taking it from people. The dog then would use the fire to light its prey and scare off predators. This didn't always work however, and the Canis Careyus sometimes would burn forests. As a result, many forest fires were a result of the Canis Careyus. The Canis Careyus was an apex predator that lived a short life.
